# OMS-Organization-Management-System-
This a unique Organization Management System App(Project).

This app is made with the help of JavaFX, Intellij, ScenBuilder.

After login into this app, we will find the home page. On the Home page, We will find the Notice board, Employee panel, Owner panel, About us, Gallery off success, etc option. Here I have made some psychological things. In Example Home page background image, so that users can get a friendly environment. In the owner panel, the background image is black and I have just added a logo so that users can easily focus on their work. It is very hard to explain all the things properly about this app.

I have uploaded all the files. It will be better to run this app personally to understand the process and psychological things of this app.
