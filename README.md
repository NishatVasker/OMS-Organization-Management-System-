# OMS-Organization-Management-System-
This an unique Organization Management System App(Project) .

This app is made with the help of JavaFx,Intellij,ScenBuilder.

After login in this app we will find home page.
In Home page We will find Notice board, Employee panel, Ownwer panel, About us, Gallery off success etc option.
Here i have made some psychological things.In Exammple Home page backgroud image , so that users can get a friendly environment.
In owner panel the background image is black and i have just add a logo so that users can easily focus on their work.
It is very hard to explain all the things properly about this app.

I have uploaded all the file.
It will be better to run this app personally to understand the process and psychology things of this app.
